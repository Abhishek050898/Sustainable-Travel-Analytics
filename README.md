**Industry partner**: BYES Contracting/ EQUANS Data Centres    

## Aim
To promote and facilitate sustainable company travel practices by providing actionable insights that can lead to more sustainable and environmentally conscious travel decisions. 

## Objectives:
1. **Carbon footprint assessment**: Evaluate the environmental impacts of company travel by analysing carbon emissions associated with different modes of company transportation and accommodation.

2.  
   a) **Optimisation of routes**: Identify and suggest sustainable routes and transportation options to reduce overall environmental impact.  
   b) **Public transport usage**: Analyse data to understand the use of public transportation, identifying areas where it can be improved for better environmental outcomes.  
   c) **Traffic pattern analysis**: Examine travel data to understand peak travel times and locations.

3. **Sustainability in accommodation**: Assess associated emissions and practices of company accommodation in the travel data and recommend more sustainable options (e.g., leading sustainable accommodation per location with the lowest related emissions).

4. **Behavioural analysis**: Understand traveller behaviour to develop strategies that promote sustainable choices and practices during travel.

## Outcomes:
1. Overview of the environmental impact of company travel.
2. Analysis and identification of optimal transportation routes.
3. Analysis and identification of sustainable accommodation choices.
4. Recommendations for sustainable transport strategies based on the analysis of travel behaviours.
